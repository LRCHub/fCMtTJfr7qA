Sometimes it feels that the darkness has taken over
I know sometimes it feels that hope's just not there
Don't be alarmed and don't think that you are the only
Everyone down here has their own burden to bear
And I know sometimes you might feel that you will go crazy
I know sometimes it feels you're losing your mind
I too have heard some twisted things inside my head
And I'm pretty sure it's all just a part of life
And when summer comes around everybody can forget they exist
Even just for a while
And some of us I guess will never remember again
I know sometimes when you are feeling lonely
You might even feel you're all alone in this world
But being alone ain't always such a bad thing
You might start hearing things you've never heard
And sometimes it feels that things used to be so much better
Oh, it feels so nice to think what you've done in the past
But death does not care if you think one way or another
So spend your life well and enjoy it while it lasts
And when summer comes around everybody can forget they exist
Even just for a while
And some of us I guess will never remember again
And when summer comes around everybody can seize to exist
Even just for a while
And some of us I guess will never exist again
And some of us I guess will never exist again
Never again
