These days I feel beat up and broken
As if my bones have been crushed up
Every day I think about nothing but bad, bad thoughts
They get me so worked up
I always had my head in the clouds
What do you do when they blow away
Everything looks so bleak and distant
There's nothing I can do
Nowhere to run away

Enjoy it while it lasts
Those days in love, can't get them back
I try so hard to just keep moving on
But all my passions are all gone
Enjoy it while it lasts
Those days in love, can't get them back
I try so hard to just keep moving on
But all my passions are all gone

What's missing?
What was taken away?
Tragedy strikes every single day
Out of touch and losing faith
That someday soon we'll be okay
I'm losing
Sight of beauty in life
Good for nothing, barely alive
Seeing red and out of control
I'm not sure how much further I can go

Enjoy it while it lasts
Those days in love, can't get them back
I try so hard to just keep moving on
But all my passions are all gone
Enjoy it while it lasts
Those days in love, can't get them back
I try so hard to just keep moving on
But all my passions are all gone

Enjoy it while it lasts
Those days in love, can't get them back
I try so hard to just keep moving on
But all my passions are all gone
Enjoy it while it lasts
Those days in love, can't get them back
I try so hard to just keep moving on
But all my passions are all gone
