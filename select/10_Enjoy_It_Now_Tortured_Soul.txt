Hey, you say, you wanna make it last all day
You say you don't want the feeling to go away
And shoot, huh, feelings this good are hard to find
I feel sad that we don't have just a little more time
(You-you-you) You know that things are temporary
(It won't last you know it, now's your chance to do it)
I wish it wasn't necessary
(All things end, you know it)
So enjoy it now
I'll show you how
It won't be long
Before it's gone
Enjoy it soon
In September or June
I'll show you how
Enjoy it now
Why don't you try, you might like what you're missing
Instead of standing there we could be kissing
Don't wait til' next time, next time might be a thousand days
Or maybe never, so c'mon and take a chance and play
Baby, don't you wanna try the things you think of
Life is short don't pass this chance up it might be love
You know the only thing we have is love
(Life is short, you know it)
So enjoy it now
I'll show you how
It won't be long
Before it's gone
Enjoy it soon
In September or June
I'll show you how
Enjoy it now
It won't last you know it
It won't last you know it
Now's your chance to do it
Now's your chance to do it
Now's your chance to do it
So enjoy it now
I'll show you how
It won't be long
Before it's gone
Enjoy it soon
In September or maybe June
In June
I'll show you how
Enjoy it now
