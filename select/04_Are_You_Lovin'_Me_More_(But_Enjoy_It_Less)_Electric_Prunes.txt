Mantz-Tucker

Queen bee you give so much honey I'd never feel your sting
But is it true you can overdo too much of a good thing
Once I couold feel it baby you had heart up to here
Now you wheel and deal it baby when I'm holdin you near

Chorus

Are You Lovin me More but enjoyin it less
Do you wanna say no while your tellin me yes... confess

I thought you were more than eager to march in my parade
But in lookin behind me now I think that you have strayed
Yeah I've been too easy baby and this I do regret
Cause you seem to like the gettin when it's harder to get

Chorus
